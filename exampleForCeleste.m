% These data come into MATLAB as WAVEFORM objects. This way they
% contain all the META-information we need. If you have not done so
% already, go to this website and check out this code with svn:
% https://code.google.com/p/gismotools/source/checkout
% SVN is like GITHUB, but the old version. If you do not want to use
% SVN, you can simply download this toolbox and add it to your MATLAB
% path, after you save it somewhere on your machine. All of the codes
% are buuilt on this WAVEFORM object. Plus this toolbox offers some
% useful plotting and processing tools for passive seismic data.

%% remove any blank traces

%% frequency filter data

W_filt = filtfilt(Filt,W); % apply the filter to the data 

% % plot to see what filter has done to data
% C = correlation(W_filt);
% plot(C);

%% Preprocess data

% In this section, we need to despike the data and determine whether
% or not we will 'whiten' the data. If we whiten, we need to choose
% the method for whitening.

FB       = [fmin, fmax];
W_whiten = WhitenWaveform(W,FB);

% C = correlation(W_whiten);
% plot(C);

%% Crosscorrelate all combinations for data, output saved to outputDirectory

% We do this by first computing the frequency domain data that we need.

% Next we do a double loop over all possible stations implemented in
% parallel.
